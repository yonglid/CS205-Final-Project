Current team: Peter Chang and Yong Li Dich

Goal: Parallelize Peter's Research Project 

Observe sea squirt that pumps blood in two directions to determine potential mathematical methods that govern the reversals within the heart, which would be tested through simulation.

Methods: random variation method and a controlled shifting method

Language: Used Python - but might be re-coding in C or transforming with Cython
